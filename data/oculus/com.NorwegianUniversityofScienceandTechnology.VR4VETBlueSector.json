They now disappear when the player progresses further.\n- The hints above the 360 videos in the fish maintenance scenario are now written in English.\n- The NPC in the fish factory scenario\u2019s bleeding station is named \u201cBernard\u201d instead of \u201cBent\u201d.\n- The NPC in the fish factory scenario\u2019s bleeding station has had his dialogue corrected when talking about welfare standards.\n- There is less overlap in the answers of the introduction dialogue of the NPC in the sorting task in the factory scenario\u2019s quality assurance room. \n\n## Fixed:\n- We fixed a bug where the laboratory NPC\u2019s dialogue broke when placing incorrect objects on the scale in the condition factor task.\n- The laboratory task no longer breaks when interacting with the microscope while receiving feedback from the NPC.\n- It is no longer possible to teleport onto the laboratory room\u2019s ceiling.\n- The NPC will now return to its initial rotation after it finishes pointing.\n- The laboratory scenario\u2019s microscope now has the correct lens positioning corresponding to the displayed magnification level.\n- The fish maintenance scenario NPC\u2019s button for progressing the dialogue is no longer blocked by invisible elements and is always reachable.\n- The fish factory scenario\u2019s bleeding station NPC no longer breaks when his dialogue progresses past the section about welfare standards.\n- NPCs\u2019 dialogue boxes now rotate when the NPCs themselves turn, making the dialogue text always face forwards.", "created_date": 1734514943, "id":

real use case.\n- We added text-to-speech to tool tips, the tablet, the start tutorial, and the main menu.\n- We added posters that show the different quality tiers of salmon in the quality assurance station and the different states of gutted fish in the gutting station.\n- We gave NPCs the ability to point with their hands, which is now used in the laboratory scenario to show which objects the NPC is talking about.\n\n## Changed:\n- We made minor changes to the dialogue in the fish factory scenario to make it easier to understand.\n- We moved the conveyor belt activation button in the gutting station of the fish factory onto the platform where the player operates the machinery, making it easier to reach.\n- We made the spaces between the steps of the stairs in the bleeding station of the fish factory impassable to prevent players from accidentally teleporting through the stairs and onto the floor underneath.\n- The button for skipping NPC dialogues is now grayed out when a section is unskippable.\n- The choice between basic and advanced difficulty modes in the fish feeding scenario is now integrated into the NPC\u2019s dialogue, rather than the physical buttons on the table.\n- The scale in the laboratory scenario is moved further away from the device used to enter answers to prevent unwanted placements of objects on it when interacting with the scale.\n\n## Fixed:\n- We fixed a bug where the \u201cHandling of dead fish\u201d subtask in the maintenance scenario did not trigger consistently.\n- We partially fixed a bug where the player could spawn at incorrect coordinates after scene transitions.\n- We fixed a bug where the player could drop the tablet onto the floor in the fish factory scenario.\n- We made the anesthetic bottle unable to be placed in the player\u2019s pocket to prevent unwanted overdosing of fish in the fish welfare scenario.\n- We made the knives in the bleeding station appear on the table where they should be discarded if they fall through the floor.\n- We disabled collisions between the player and various objects in the fish factory scenario to prevent unwanted elevation when picking up objects.\n- We made it impossible to place the 360 video headset into the player\u2019s pocket in the bleeding station of the fish factory.\n- We made the speedboats used for traveling between scenes move consistently up and down, preventing them from hovering or being submerged under the water.\n- We prevent the player from getting stuck on the ocean floor in the reception area and the fish maintenance scenario by moving the player back to their initial spawn position if positioned too low.\n- We fixed an issue where fish can be stretched in the fish factory scenario by forcing the player to let go with one of their hands if stretched past a threshold. If a fish gets stuck on an object in the scene while held with one hand, the fish is teleported towards that hand.\n- The NPC returns to the correct part of its dialogue when the player does an incorrect action in the laboratory scenario.\n- We fixed an issue where the NPC dialogue wouldn\u2019t finish properly on branch points.\n\n## Developer:\n- The project\u2019s unit tests had to be deleted to make the BNG framework\u2019s namespace visible to the fish factory scenario\u2019s scripts. This was necessary to correct the player\u2019s position after scene transitions.

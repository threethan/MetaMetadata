{"apps_id": 41173, "name": "Skill Issue VR", "summary": "In this game, it's not enough to just aim and throw - you need to think carefully about every move, as the ball's path, speed and interaction with surfaces is determined by realistic physics simulation. Your goal is simple: throw the ball so that it bounces off all objects and hits the target perfectly. But this challenge goes far beyond ordinary skill games, as each track is a unique puzzle that requires logic, strategy and precision.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/1931289/473391934_478586511648165_5990169780551503385_n.jpg", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/1931289/473391934_478586511648165_5990169780551503385_n.jpg", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 1, "is_seated": false, "packagename": "com.autogen.1740694651808", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": "https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8455397034566726/", "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": false, "created": "1740694661786", "license": "PAID", "rating": "0", "number_of_rating": "0", "downloads": "2", "oculus_auto_generated": true, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": "Ecsedi", "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}

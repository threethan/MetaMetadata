{"apps_id": 53706, "name": "VR PHYSICS GRAVITY CONCEPT ON DIFFERENT PLANETS", "summary": "VR Gravity Lab is an immersive physics learning application built using Unity, designed to help students understand gravity concepts through real-time interaction. Learners can explore planetary environments such as Earth, Moon, and Mars, perform hands-on experiments, and observe how gravity affects motion and objects. By combining interactive simulations with visual feedback, the platform makes complex gravity concepts engaging, intuitive, and easy to understand for educational use.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/3866910/gravity.png", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/3252654/gemini_generated_image_hnangrhnangrhnan.png", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 1, "is_seated": true, "packagename": "com.SIMATS.VRPhysicsGravityConceptonDifferentPlanets", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": null, "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": false, "created": "1771044925714", "license": "FREE", "rating": "0", "number_of_rating": "0", "downloads": "10", "oculus_auto_generated": false, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": null, "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}

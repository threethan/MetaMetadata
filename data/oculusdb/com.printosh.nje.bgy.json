From there you move on to grape processing, setting up the grape washer, the crusher and finally the pressing machine to extract the fresh grape juice. Next comes the fermentation where the grape juice and yeast are transferred into a steel tank to begin the transformation into wine. After this the aging phase awaits where you calculate the barrel capacity using the Hoffman formula and carefully let the wine mature.\n\nStabilization follows as you configure the stabilizing machine to ensure the wine is ready for blending. In the Blending stage you combine different wines to achieve the best balance and character. Packaging allows you to design your own bottle by choosing the shape color and label and you can even sign it for a personal touch. The experience concludes with Tasting where you receive marketing insights and enjoy the wine you created.\n\nA quiz system tests your knowledge at the end of each phase making learning part of the fun.

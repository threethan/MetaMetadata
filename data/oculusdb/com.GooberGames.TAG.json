Spread the fun (and the fear!) across different maps like the tricky Caves and the high-flying Clouds.\n\nZone Tag: Think Echo VR, but with gravity. It's an intense, team-based battle to grab the ball and slam it into the other team's goal. Get ready to make some serious plays.\n\nCapture the Flag: Pure team-based chaos. Snatch their flag, get it back to your base, and try not to get tagged on the way.\n\nFireball Monke: It's PvP, but with... well, fireballs. Dodge, dip, and blast the other monkes.\n\nBomb Tag: A high-stakes game of hot potato. The timer's ticking! don't be the one holding the bomb when it blows!\n\nChallenges: Test your parkour! Jump into modes like Orion Drift or other custom challenges. The goal is simple: collect all the cubes and do not touch the kill blocks.\n\nCustom Maps: Tired of the official maps?

Either way, you can chat with other players via **voice chat**.\n\n # Some of The Gamemodes:\n\n- **Casual**: In this gamemode, there is no task or purpose, you can simply chill with your friends or other players. Perhaps you can even practice your skills.\n\n- **Hot Potato**: In this gamemode, you have to run from the player who has the bomb. Players can pass the bomb by tagging other players. If you have the bomb when the timer ends, you turn into the ghost. Once one last player is standing, the game restarts and everyone is revived.\n\n- **Infection**: In this gamemode, you have to run from players who have turned to lava. If you are tagged, you will be turned to lava as well. Once all players are lava, the game restarts and a random lava player is chosen.\n\n\n", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "Enter the exciting world of **Trash Tag**, full of unique and fun gamemodes!

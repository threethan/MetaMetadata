In total there are 36 variations of play.\n\nYou have the ability to: change the color of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.\n\nThe goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire).

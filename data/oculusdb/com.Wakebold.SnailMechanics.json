It\u2019s a busy day, and they could use your help to fix spaceships flying in off the space freeway. Whoever said a snail\u2019s pace is slow hasn\u2019t met these snail mechanics! Can you keep up with the repairs?\n\nIn Snail Mechanics, it\u2019s a race against the clock to find and repair broken parts on each ship that flies into the garage. But you must work with the snail mechanics to get the job done. Squeegee off the space shields, suction brolluscs out of the vents, glue pipes with snail slime, and more! You can play solo or in a shared space with a friend in local co-op mode.  \n\nThanks for checking out Snail Mechanics! We're still working on the game, but we've got a demo ready for you to try.

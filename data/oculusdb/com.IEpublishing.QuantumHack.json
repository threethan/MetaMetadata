Designed for pairs of players, it challenges them to work together to solve a series of engaging puzzles, each grounded in real quantum computing principles. As an unknown hacker takes over the system, only by mastering the rules of quantum mechanics can the students regain control and save the facility.\n \nThroughout the experience, players manipulate qubits and confront interactive challenges that bring to life core concepts such as superposition, quantum entanglement, and quantum coherence, among others. The puzzles are not only fun and collaborative but are also embedded with key educational insights, helping players intuitively understand what quantum computing is and why it holds transformative potential across industries.\n \nThe experience lasts approximately 30 to 40 minutes and is designed to be played in pairs using the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

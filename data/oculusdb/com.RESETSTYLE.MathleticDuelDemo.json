Victory is achieved by correctly answering 10 questions before being defeated by the monsters, which also escalates the level of difficulty. As levels increase, the complexity of the math problems and the number of punches required to input answers also grow. Speed and accuracy in both computational skills and punching technique are essential. \n\nEach response's correctness and time taken are recorded per question, and correct answers earn points.

Forget conventional jump scares; this is a sophisticated adventure where the unsettling atmosphere is tailored directly to the player. We invite you to step into a seemingly endless hallway, a minimalist space that transforms into a psychological labyrinth the moment you take your first step.\n\nThe core of this experience lies in genuine player interaction. To progress, you must solve a series of puzzles subtly woven into the architecture of the corridor. These challenges are designed to keep you engaged, but they also serve as triggers for moments of gentle fright. Crucially, The Corridor is a true free-roam experience. There are no artificial teleportation mechanics. Your physical steps are your only means of locomotion, making your movement a critical game mechanic.\n\nThe environment responds to your fear. Your speed, hesitation, and direction dictate the atmosphere. Move quickly and confidently or slow down, look over your shoulder, or freeze in place, and the corridor will immediately react, intensifying your rising anxiety.\n\nTo fully immerse yourself and reach every part of the scenario as intended, an unobstructed play space of at least 3 meters by 6 meters (10ft by 20ft) is required.\n\nAre you ready to walk the line between fear and fascination?\nClear your space, put on your headset, and enter The Corridor now.", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "Welcome to The Corridor, the new virtual reality experience from Expacia that redefines soft horror.

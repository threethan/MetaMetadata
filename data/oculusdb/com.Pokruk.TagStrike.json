Unlike other games, where performance can drop when many players join a lobby, **Tag Strike** ensures stable FPS and smooth gameplay, even with dozens of players.\n\n- **Perfectly Recreated Physics**: We\u2019ve carefully replicated the familiar physics from other similar games, so players can immediately feel comfortable with the movement mechanics they\u2019ve come to love.\n\n- **Automatic Round Timekeeping**: Our game features automatic time tracking and round counters, providing a seamless and organized gaming experience.\n\n- **Unlimited Player Capacity**: With our server-based architecture, there is essentially no limit to the number of players a server can handle. This allows for massive meetups and in-game events with large numbers of participants, something that peer-to-peer networks often struggle with.\n\nWith **Tag Strike**, you get a smoother, more customizable, and fairer multiplayer experience.

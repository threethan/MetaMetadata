feel are recreated with care.\nIts weight, handling, and the tension of facing a muzzle create an immersive VR experience.\nAmmo patterns change every round, producing natural mind games driven by luck, deduction, and courage.\n\nGameplay is round-based.\nAfter each shot, the shotgun automatically moves to the next player\u2019s spot.\nA monitor arm on the table shows ammo, turn order, and hints without blocking your view.\n\nTo heighten the excitement, several special items can be used\u2014ones that let you peek at a round, boost shot power, or take high-risk gambles that change the match.\n\nDesigned as a party-style VR experience, MR Real-Shotgun brings players together at one virtual table, mixing fear and laughter in every match.\nIt works both as a focused small-group

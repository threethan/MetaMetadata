Use your hands to climb, leap, and swing through warped environments, where verticality and agility are the only paths to survival. Enemies are faster, the world is more hostile, and every encounter forces you to think like a predator \u2014 or be hunted like prey.\n\nWith enhanced VR mechanics, improved visuals, and a refined movement system, Lethal Reborn doesn\u2019t just revive Lethal Ape \u2014 it transforms it. Whether you\u2019re escaping through broken landscapes, testing your reflexes against brutal challenges, or simply exploring the eerie, atmospheric world, every moment pushes you deeper into the chaos.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a remake.

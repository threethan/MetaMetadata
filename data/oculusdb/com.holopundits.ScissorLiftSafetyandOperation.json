Then, participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to learn the central controls and steps required for starting up. Embedded learning outcomes based on Bloom\u2019s revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying. \n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn and practice safely operating a scissor lift in a safe and realistic format. Before beginning their tasks, participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct a thorough walk-around inspection of the lift. They must then navigate through the warehouse, collecting task items and repairing them at heights ranging from 25 to 45 feet. \n", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "Scissor lifts are flexible vehicles that help workers reach heights up to 60 ft. safely and efficiently without the need for ladders or scaffolding.

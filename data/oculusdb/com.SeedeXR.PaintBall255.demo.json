Unlike conventional paintball games that typically feature militaristic or industrial backdrops, Paintball 255 invites players into a vibrant world where they must target and knock down symbolic African cultural artifacts, such as African pots. The game is a direct challenge to the dominance of Eurocentric and Asian design tropes in the gaming industry. By centering Black and African identities, Paintball 255 becomes a tool for representation, encouraging players, especially youth, to see their culture reflected in digital spaces.

Enemies will adapt too, and block your attacks easily if you repeat them.\n\n- Feel like a wizard: basic spells have no annoying mana system or spells cooldown, you can cast any spell you've learned any time you want, like a true wizard! You'll rely on your speed, precision and knowledge for using the right spell at the right time to survive.\n\n- Cast charged spells: as you progress you'll learn to cast charged spells, a more powerful version of a basic spell you know. They take power charge to cast but are far more powerful.\n\n- Powered by Unreal Engine 5: While in early development, the game has a big focus on optimization, so with future updates it can really use all of UE5 power to bring the best possible graphics to the quest.\n\n- Your imagination is the limit: the gameplay is designed to limit you as little as possible, you can defeat your enemies every way you want, and use spells in creative ways.\n\nMore features coming soon!", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "Become a wizard apprentice and engage in duels with other sorcerers, casting spells with your wand by drawing specific shapes.

The goal is to survive as many nights as possible, earning XP to buy survival tools.\n\nThe game alternates between day and night. During the day, players are safe and can explore, interact, and purchase tools using XP. Players strategise and form teams for better survival chances.\n\nAt night, creatures emerge, hunting players. Some are slow and predictable, while others are fast and cunning. Players must stay on the move, use tools wisely, and cooperate. Hiding may work briefly, but the creatures are relentless. Surviving the night rewards XP, but staying out too long is dangerous. Reaching sunrise grants XP for use the next day.\n\nUp to dozens of players can join a lobby, fostering cooperation and competition. Proximity voice chat enhances encounters. Some may build safe zones, while others brave the night alone for greater rewards.\n\nWith movement-based VR gameplay, cooperative horror, and social dynamics, Doobles offers an exhilarating survival experience.

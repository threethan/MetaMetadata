One second, you're running for your life from a bloodthirsty creature, and the next, you're smacking a screaming skeleton with a frying pan while disco music plays in the background. Primal Blood isn't just horror, it's a glorious mess of chaos, fear, and comedy that keeps you guessing what's real and what's just... your headset glitching.\n\nExpect jump scares that turn into punchlines, creepy monsters that tell bad jokes, and random moments that make you question your sanity (and your controller batteries). Each level is packed with strange encounters, from haunted refrigerators to overly dramatic ghosts who just need therapy.\n\nIt's unpredictable, weirdly addictive, and surprisingly hilarious, the kind of VR experience you'll talk about long after you've screamed, laughed, and possibly thrown your controller once or twice.\n\nSo if you're ready for a horror game that refuses to take itself seriously, where every scream might be followed by a snort of laughter, step into Primal Blood (PB) .

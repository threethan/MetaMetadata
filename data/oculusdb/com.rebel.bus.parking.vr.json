Designed for Meta Quest, this VR simulator puts you behind the wheel of multiple bus types including city buses, school buses, coach buses, double-decker buses, mini-buses, and articulated buses. Navigate complex environments, complete challenging parking missions.\n\nUse realistic steering controls, mirrors, door open, headlight, hazel light and reverse cameras to park with precision in tight, obstacle-filled environments.\n\nExperience the true-to-life physics of bus driving as you reverse into tight spots, avoid traffic cones, steer through narrow streets, and handle real parking obstacles. Whether it\u2019s a crowded terminal or a compact city corner, each level tests your precision, control, and timing.\n\nBuilt for fans of VR bus simulators, bus parking games, and public transportation simulation, this game features advanced VR controls, smooth handling, and high-detail 3D environments. Choose from various camera angles, fine-tune your steering, and unlock harder levels as you improve.\n\nIf you enjoy bus driver VR games, real bus parking challenges, or vehicle control training, this is your chance to prove your skills. Whether you're driving a passenger bus, tourist coach, or transport vehicle, every mission brings a new test of skill and patience.\n\nDownload now and test your skills in the most realistic bus parking game available in VR on the Meta Horizon Store!", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "Bus Parking VR: Simulation Game delivers the most realistic and immersive bus driving experience in virtual reality.

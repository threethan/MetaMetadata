MASTER MOMENTUM. JOIN THE EVOLUTION.\n\nWelcome to the beta phase of **FLUX**, an exciting new VR esports game set in a captivating low-gravity environment. As we continue development, we invite players to experience the core gameplay and help shape the future of this innovative competitive experience.\n\n### CURRENT GAMEPLAY\n\nFLUX takes place in a low-gravity arena where traditional movement is transformed into an exciting new challenge. Players navigate through minimalist environments, learning to master momentum and positioning as they compete against opponents. The simplified controls allow for accessibility while offering depth for those who practice.\n\nThe basic gameplay revolves around team-based objectives in a weightless environment, encouraging players to think and react in three dimensions. With 360-degree movement freedom, you'll need to develop entirely new strategies that wouldn't be possible in conventional games.\n\n### BETA FEATURES\n\nIn this early version, you can expect:\n\n- **Core Movement System**: Experience our initial low-gravity physics as we continue to refine the feeling of weightless navigation.\n\n- **Basic Match Structure**: Simple team-based gameplay with straightforward objectives while we develop more complex modes.\n\n- **Fundamental Arena Design**: Clean, functional spaces designed to highlight movement mechanics rather than visual spectacle.", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "# FLUX (BETA)\n\n## DEFY GRAVITY.

See clearly, think quickly, and respond accurately before time runs out.\nEach enemy is defined by two simple traits: **color** and **shape**. Identify them instantly and respond with the correct hand and input. \nThe rules start simple, but intensity rises quickly. Enemies spawn faster, timers shrink, and hesitation becomes costly. High scores are earned through rhythm and restraint, not reckless speed. Chain precise responses, build combos, and stay in control.\nTwo modes support different play styles. **Casual Mode** offers maximum clarity for learning and confidence. **Hard Mode** removes all safety nets for a pure test of reflexes, memory, and focus.\nProgression rewards skill, not grind. Earn XP, unlock badges and achievements, and climb the global leaderboards to measure your precision against others.\nNo random power-ups. No gimmicks. No shortcuts.\nJust precise inputs under pressure.\n**Key Features**\n- Minimalist abstract visuals designed for maximum clarity in VR\n- Controller-only gameplay with deliberate, skill-based inputs\n- Color and shape mechanics that test coordination, focus, and memory\n- Combo systems that reward rhythm, restraint, and flow\n- Casual and Hard modes, each offering distinct challenges\n- Global leaderboards for competitive players\n- Achievements, badges, and progression systems that celebrate mastery", "display_long_description_unprocessed": "**Precision beats panic.** \n\nThis minimalist VR reflex game is a fast-paced, abstract arcade experience focused on clarity, control, and composure under pressure.
